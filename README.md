# ABC-Tech-ITSM
The ABC Tech ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) Project leverages machine learning to enhance IT service management processes. This project aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of handling IT service tickets, forecasting incident volumes, and predicting potential failures or misconfigurations in ITSM assets.
Predicting High Priority Tickets: Develop models to identify tickets that are likely to become high priority, enabling proactive resolution.
Forecasting Incident Volumes: Create forecasting models to predict incident volumes quarterly and annually for better resource and technology planning.
Auto-Tagging Tickets: Implement an automated system for categorizing and tagging tickets based on their content, reducing manual effort.
Predicting RFCs (Request for Change) and Potential Failures: Predict potential RFCs and possible failures or misconfigurations of ITSM assets, facilitating timely interventions
